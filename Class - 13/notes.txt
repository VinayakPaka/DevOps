✨ kubeadm init

The command kubeadm init converts a machine into a Master Node (Control Plane node).

After initializing, we:

Set up the Control Plane components, and

Generate a join command for worker nodes.

This join command is used on another machine to make it a Worker Node.

✨ Behavior of Control Plane During Failures
Pod Container Crash

If a container inside a pod crashes:

Kubelet continuously monitors pod health.

It instructs the Container Runtime (CRI) to restart or recreate the container.

After recovery, Kubelet informs the API Server that the pod was recreated.

System-Level Crash

If the entire system/node crashes, Kubernetes cannot recreate the pod automatically unless:

A Controller (Deployment, StatefulSet, ReplicaSet, etc.) is managing it.

Bare pods (pods created directly without controllers) will not be restored automatically.

✨ API Concepts

Every Kubernetes REST API endpoint has an API Version.

Metadata refers to information about the resource, such as:

Name

Namespace

Labels

Annotations

UID

✨ Useful kubectl Commands

View ReplicaSets

kubectl get rs
Displays all ReplicaSets.

Apply a Manifest File
