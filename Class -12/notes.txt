Kubernetes – Clean & Rephrased Notes
✨ API Server & Kubelet Workflow

Kubelet sends REST API requests to the API Server.

The API Server handles authentication, authorization, and validation of all incoming requests.

After validation, the API Server interacts with etcd, the key-value store for cluster state.

✨ Kubernetes Scheduler

Works on an event-driven architecture.

Selects the most suitable node for pod placement based on resource requirements, constraints, and scheduling rules.

✨ Pod

A Pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes.

It can contain one or more containers.

Containers inside a pod are:

Co-scheduled (run together)

Co-located (run on the same node)

The API Server instructs the Kubelet to create pods.

✨ Kubelet

Works with the Container Runtime Interface (CRI) to create and manage containers inside pods.

Continuously reports pod status back to the API Server.

Also sends node status to the API Server at regular intervals.

✨ Data Plane

The Data Plane consists of the physical or virtual machines where the pods and containers actually run.

It includes components responsible for executing workloads, such as the kubelet and container runtime.

✨ Node

A Node is typically a virtual machine (commonly 95% of real use cases).

It can also be a physical machine, depending on cluster setup.

✨ Communication Between Master & Worker Nodes

Worker → Master: Must communicate through a Load Balancer.

Master → Worker: Can communicate directly without requiring a load balancer.
